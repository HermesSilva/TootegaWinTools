// TootegaWinMFCLib - XApplication.cpp
// NOTE: This file is intentionally empty. The XApplication class implementation
// MUST be provided by the executable project (TootegaVideoTool), not the library.
// MFC requires the application object (theApp) to be defined in the executable module.
// 
// See TootegaVideoTool/Source/XApplication.cpp for the actual implementation.

#include "pch.h"
#include "XApplication.h"

// The XApplication class is declared in the header but NOT implemented here.
// This allows the executable to provide its own implementation while still
// being able to use the class declaration from the library headers.
